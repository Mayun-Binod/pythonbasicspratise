# 1.Assign the value 10 to a variable a. Then, use an assignment operator to multiply a by 5 and print the result.
a=10
a=a*5
print(a)

# 2.Create two variables x and y. Assign x = 20 and y = 5. Use an assignment operator to add the value of y to x and print the new value of x.
x=20
y=5
x+=y
print(x)

# 3.Write a Python program to swap the values of two variables m and n using the assignment operator.

variable=20,30
m,n=variable
print(m,n)

# 4.Assign 100 to a variable b. Use an assignment operator to subtract 25 from b and print the result.
b=100
b-=25
print(b)


# 5.Create a variable z = 50. Use the assignment operator to divide z by 2 and print the result.

z=50
z/=2
print(z)

# 6.Assign the value 15 to a. Use an assignment operator to raise a to the power of 3 and print the result.
a=15
a**=3
print(a)

# 7.Write a Python program to initialize p = 12 and q = 7. Use an assignment operator to compute p % q and store the result in p, then print the result
p=12
q=7
p%=q
print(p)

# 8. Create a variable salary = 5000. Use an assignment operator to increase salary by 10% and print the updated salary
salary=5000
salary=salary+(10/100*salary)
print(salary)
