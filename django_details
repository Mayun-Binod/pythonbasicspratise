Django is a high-level, open-source web framework for developing web applications quickly and with clean, pragmatic design. Here's an overview of key Django concepts:
1. Installation
=>Install Django using pip:
pip install django
To create a Django project:
=>django-admin startproject projectname

2. Project and App Structure
A project contains settings and configurations, while apps contain specific functionality (like a blog or a forum).
To create an app within a project:
=>python manage.py startapp appname

3. Models
Models define the structure of your database tables. Each model is a class that subclasses django.db.models.Model.
Example:
from django.db import models

class Customer(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    email = models.EmailField()

Example:
python
Copy code
from django.db import models

class Customer(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    email = models.EmailField()

4. Views
Views are Python functions or classes that handle HTTP requests and return HTTP responses.
Example of a function-based view:
from django.shortcuts import render

def index(request):
    return render(request, 'index.html')

5. URLs
URLs route requests to the correct view. In each app, create a urls.py file to define routes, then include it in the project’s main urls.py.
Example:
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index, name='index'),
]

8. Forms
Django forms handle form creation, validation, and data processing.
Example:
from django import forms
from .models import Customer

class CustomerForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Customer
        fields = ['name', 'email']

12. Database Migrations
Migrations are Django’s way of propagating model changes to the database.
Commands:
=>python manage.py makemigrations
=>python manage.py migrate
