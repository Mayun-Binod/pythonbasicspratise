In Django, serving static files (like CSS, JavaScript, and images) requires configuring the settings to define where the static files are located and how they should be served, especially in a development or production environment.

Step 1: Configure Static Settings in settings.py
Add the following settings in your settings.py file:

# Base URL for static files
STATIC_URL = '/static/'

# Directory where static files will be collected for production (e.g., using `collectstatic`)
STATIC_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'staticfiles'

# Additional locations for static files
STATICFILES_DIRS = [
    BASE_DIR / 'static',  # Or any other directory where your static files are located
]
Step 2: Create a static Directory
In your app or project root, create a folder named static if it doesn’t already exist. Inside this directory, organize your static files like CSS, JS, and images.

Step 3: Include {% static %} Template Tag
In your templates, use the {% static %} template tag to reference static files. Make sure you load the static tag at the top of your template file:

{% load static %}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'css/styles.css' %}">
<img src="{% static 'images/logo.png' %}" alt="Logo">
Step 4: Serve Static Files (Development)
Django automatically serves static files in development mode (DEBUG=True). However, in production, you’ll need to configure your web server (like Nginx or Apache) to serve the static files from the STATIC_ROOT location.

Step 5: Collect Static Files (Production)
Before deploying, run the collectstatic command to gather all static files into the STATIC_ROOT directory:

=>python manage.py collectstatic
This command copies all static files from each app and the locations in STATICFILES_DIRS to STATIC_ROOT.
